<h1>Bio</h1>
<div id="subtitle">Uday V. Shanbhag has been a Professor in the department of Industrial and Operations Engineering at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor since Fall, 2024.
From January 2017 to June 2024, he held the Gary and Sheila
Chaired Professorsip in the department of Industrial and Manufacturing
Engineering (IME) at the Pennsylvania State University, having been a tenured
associate professor until 2016, since arriving in Fall 2012. Prior to being at
Penn. State, from 2006&ndash;2012, he was first an assistant professor, and
subsequently a tenured associate professor (for approx. 10 days), in the
department of Industrial and Enterprise Systems engineering (ISE) at the
University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC).

<p>His research interests
lie in the development of analytical tools and scalable computational schemes
for optimization and equilibrium problems, with a focus on addressing
uncertainty, nonsmoothness and nonconvexity. Much of his research finds
application in the realm of power systems and markets, where he has examined a
range of questions, including the examination of strategic interactions in
multi-settlement markets under uncertainty, the location of electrical
substations and dynamic competitive equilibrium models. More recently, he has
begun working on a broad class of nonconvex and stochastic statistical learning
problems. 
</p>
<p>His research honors include  the triennial A.W. Tucker Prize by the
mathematical programming society (MPS) in 2006,  the NCSA Faculty Fellowship in
2006, the Computational Optimization and Applications (COAP) best paper award
(with  advisor Walter Murray) in 2007, and the best theoretical paper award in
the Winter Simulation Conference (WSC) in 2013 (with Angelia Nedich and Farzad
Yousefian). Additionally, he was a finalist for the Microsoft
Faculty fellowship (2008) and was awarded the National Science Foundation (NSF)
Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award in 2012 from the Operations
Research program.  Several of his doctoral students have been recognized by a
range of honors including Uma Ravat (best student paper prize at the triennial
International Conference on Stochastic Programming (2010)), Aswin Kannan
(finalist for best student paper prize at the triennial International
Conference on Stochastic Programming (2010)) and Huibing Yin (finalist for the
best student paper prize at the IEEE Conference on Decision and Control
(2009)).  Finally, his teaching has been recognized through annual teaching
awards by ISE in 2008 and 2011. He has given plenary talks at the International Conference on Continuous Optimization (Berlin 2019) and at the Workshop on Dynamics, Optimization and Variational Analysis in Applied Games (Fields Institute, Toronto, 2020). He has also given tutorial talks at the Internation Conference on Complementarity Problems (ICCP) 2012 and International Conference on Stochastic Programming (ICSP) 2019. 
</p>
<p>His service-related activities include being an associate editor for the
Allerton Conference on Computing, Communication, and Control, program committee
member on Conference on High Confidence Networked Systems
(<a href="http://www.hi-cons.org/2012/organizers.htm" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>HiCoNS</a>) (2012, 2013), Vice-chair
(Nonlinear Programming) in the Informs Optimization society (2009, 2010), and
the cluster chair for Nonlinear programming in Informs (2009, 2010).
Additionally, he was on the advisory committees for Informs Optimization
conference in Gainesville, Fl. (2010), the Midwest Informs Conference (2011),
and on the Nicholson paper prize committee in 2013.  He also served as a
co-chair of the Nicholson paper prize committee (with Kavita Ramanan) (2014). 
</p>
<p>Uday V. Shanbhag has a Ph.D. from Stanford University's department of
Management Science and Engineering (2006), with a concentration in operations
research and was associated with the Systems Optimization Laboratory when at
Stanford. He also holds masters (1998) and undergraduate (1993) degrees from the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Cambridge (in Operations Research)
and the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Bombay, respectively.
